# OpenGL Horror Game
Im building a **Horror game from scratch in OpenGL**.

## Gameloop
It will take place in a **Dark Forest**, where you have to **compelte tasks and collect items**,
while a **Monster** is haunting you.

## Contents
The player will have a flashlight.
The Forest will be dark, filled with trees and a heavy layer of fog.
Abandoned buildings and other interesting models will be scattered throughout the forest.

## Current State - Progress
Right now its just a **test World, with only a big floor of cubes**.
It does use instanced Rendering and backface culling to render even thousands of cubes efficiently.

## Release date
Im planning on having it done in maybe a year or so. Really depends on how polished i want it to be.
However it will be playable likely in **april**.
